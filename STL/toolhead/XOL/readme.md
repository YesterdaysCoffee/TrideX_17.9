This adaptor is set to match the XOL toolhead using PAP with narrow ducts.  It might fit other versions but I cannot offer specifics.  Be aware the endstop mount, if you use them, is 62mm wide and will not work with wider cowlings.

Extruder mounts will need to be modified:
The overhang will interfere with the adaptor and needs to be sliced off.  

This is a relatively simple task and can be done in most 3D editors.  Use Split in the windows program 3D builder.

Please see example file "example modified Extruder Mount- Custom_Adapter_WWG2(1).3mf" or the CAD file "9mm belt clamp with XOL adaptor v3.step".
