# TrideX_17.9
An IDEX 3D printer based on the venerable Trident by Voron Design.  Design allows for higher tension belts and higher print head speeds. Frame size and skirts are new, full use of build plate with extra space in rear for accessories.

## Optional:
- Re-use your Trident Z-drive leadscrews
- Or use Belted Z-drives derived from the VORON 2.4.
- A Toolhead Adaptor is required:
  - The adaptor for DragonBurner is provided.  Please use the cowling published here.
  - An Anthead adaptor is possible, this depends on if anyone requests it.
  
## Bed Sizes:
- 200mm x 200mm (available space for exectronics needs to be verified)
- 250mm x 250mm (my preferred size)
- 300mm x 300mm
- 350mm x 350mm  (caution, the x axis may be too long)

## [The BOM is here:]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTi7BXCdwXABu654JJwkuEAczqV8oCrgSzs1avbypUe_aI0Z33wDMpEZaGW98XtweH8u0fsfI44mL3v/pubhtml )
The BOM does not list electronics or tool head hardware.

## Future stuff:
- Fold out Deck (STLs copied from [TrideX_17]( https://github.com/YesterdaysCoffee/TrideX_17/tree/main/STLs/Deck%20%26%20Wire ) )
- construction notes, etc.
- Interior spool holders
- Filament tube fixtures and path design for spool holders
- Fixtures for overhead umbilical carrier (currently labeled experimental)
- Other wire and umbilical management structures.
It all depends on what you, the user, ask for.
